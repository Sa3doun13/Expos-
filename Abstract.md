In real-world industrial environments, unplanned events and unforeseen incidents can happen at any time. Scheduling under uncertainty allows these unexpected disruptions to be taken into account. In general, Scheduling aims to allocate a set of limited resources to perform a group of tasks throughout a period of time so that some performance goals such as makespan, tardiness, and workload can be minimized. Nowadays, the manufacturers face challenges in terms of unexpected events that occur and may cause delays in delivery, shorter product life cycles, customized products, and a changing demanding customer pattern. Furthermore, the production schedule becomes a complex problem as the number of jobs, operations, and machines increases. This thesis's main target is to build an enhanced framework that solves the large-scale Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (JSP) and reach a near-optimal solution in a reasonable time. The proposed framework will consider different unforeseen events that often happen in the manufacturing systems, such as breakdown machines, canceling orders, and the arrival of new jobs. Therefore, two conflicting objectives will be optimized, minimizing the makespan's deviation and the deviation of the operations' starting time and sequencing.
